        Snow forms when the atmospheric temperature is at or below freezing (0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit) and there is a minimum amount of moisture in the air. If the ground temperature is at or below freezing, the snow will reach the ground. ... While it can be too warm to snow, it cannot be too cold to snow.

        As skiers we are obsessed with those tiny little flakes falling from the sky – constantly on the lookout for the next powder dump and eagerly awaiting those cold mornings when you wake up to find a white blanket covering everything and the perfect powder skiing conditions!

        But a question we often ask ourselves is how is snow actually formed, what is the science behind it?
        
        Contrary to popular misconception the air temperature doesn’t have to be below freezing (0°C) for it to snow.  In fact the heaviest snow fall tends to occur when the temperature of the air is between 0-2°C.  If the temperature is above 2°C then the snowflake will begin to melt and fall as sleet instead – warmer still, and the precipitation turns into rain.
